# Gurasuraisu BETA (Made for GitHub Pages)
Ambient display with clock, weather and advanced features without tracking you or displaying ads.

# THIS GURASURAISU INSTANCE IS IN BETA. IT IS NOT STABLE, AND WILL NEVER BE.

**Visit at https://gurasuraisu.github.io**

Gurapps are apps that extend your Gurasuraisu experience. The GitHub repository for each Gurapp are seperate from the `gurasuraisu.github.io` GitHub repository.

# Running Locally
Gurapps: You must download the Gurapps from each GitHub repository and place them in the root directory in order for Gurapps to work correctly with Gurasuraisu locally.

Assets: You must edit the directory path in the code, since every path assumes that the asset is in root.
